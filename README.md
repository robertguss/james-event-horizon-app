## Quickstart

From a fresh clone to a running app with Convex + Clerk auth. This kit uses
[aube](https://aube.jdx.dev) (`aube` / `aubr` / `aubx`), not npm/pnpm scripts
directly.

### Prerequisites

| Tool     | Requirement                                                                          |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Node.js  | **20.9+** (`node -v`)                                                                |
| aube     | Install from [aube.jdx.dev](https://aube.jdx.dev) (`aube --version`)                 |
| Accounts | Free [Clerk](https://clerk.com) + [Convex](https://convex.dev) (CLI opens a browser) |

Windows: use Git Bash or WSL for the shell scripts below.

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robertguss/web-app-starter-kit.git
cd web-app-starter-kit
aube install
```

### 2. Log in to the Clerk CLI (once per machine)

```bash
aubx clerk@latest auth login
aubx clerk@latest whoami
```

Do this in a normal terminal with a browser. Do **not** run `clerk init` in this
repo. Providers, middleware, `/login`, and `/signup` already ship with the kit.

### 3. Link Convex

```bash
aubx convex dev --until-success
```

Log in / create a Convex project when prompted. This writes `VITE_CONVEX_URL`
into `.env.local` (and `setup.sh` maps any legacy `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` if
needed).

### 4. Finish Clerk + Convex JWT auth

```bash
./scripts/setup-clerk-auth.sh
# same as: aubr setup:clerk
```

This idempotent script:

1. Adds kit route defaults (`/login`, `/signup` → `/dashboard`) to `.env.local`
2. Creates or links a Clerk app and runs `clerk env pull`
3. Creates the Clerk JWT template named `convex` when missing
4. Sets `CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN` on your Convex deployment

### 5. Start the app

```bash
aubr dev
```

Runs the TanStack Start frontend and Convex backend together (`package.json` →
`dev` / `dev:frontend` / `dev:backend`).

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 6. Verify auth end to end

1. Go to [http://localhost:3000/signup](http://localhost:3000/signup) and create
   a user
2. Confirm you land on `/dashboard`
3. Sign out fully, then sign in again at `/login` (needed once after the JWT
   template is created)
4. Confirm the dashboard still loads while signed in

### One-command path

If the Clerk CLI is already logged in:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robertguss/web-app-starter-kit.git
cd web-app-starter-kit
./setup.sh
```

`./setup.sh` installs deps, runs Convex until ready, calls
`scripts/setup-clerk-auth.sh`, then starts `aubr dev`.

## Recommended Development Workflow

### Building with AI Coding Agents

This starter kit is designed to work seamlessly with AI coding agents like
**Claude Code**. For the best development experience, we recommend following the
**[BMAD Method](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD)** (Breakthrough
Method for Agile AI Driven Development).

**What is BMAD?**

The BMAD Method is a comprehensive framework that combines human expertise with
AI capabilities to build software more effectively. It provides:

- **19+ specialized AI agents** and **50+ workflows** for different development
  scenarios
- **Three planning tracks** that automatically adapt based on your project
  needs:
  - **Quick Flow Track** - Bug fixes and small features
  - **BMad Method Track** - Full products and platforms (recommended for this
    starter kit)
  - **Enterprise Method Track** - Complex systems with security and compliance
    needs

**Why BMAD with this Starter Kit?**

- Accelerates feature development while maintaining code quality
- Provides structured workflows for common tasks (auth, database, UI components)
- Helps AI agents understand your project structure and patterns
- Guides reflective thinking that brings out better architectural decisions

**Getting Started with BMAD:**

1. Review the
   [BMAD Method documentation](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD)
2. Use the `CLAUDE.md` file in this repo (pre-configured for Claude Code)
3. Follow the BMad Method Track for adding new features to your application

> **Note**: While BMAD is recommended, it's entirely optional. This starter kit
> works great with any development workflow or AI coding assistant.

## Development

### Available Scripts

```bash
# Development
aubr dev               # Run both frontend and backend in parallel
aubr dev:frontend      # Run TanStack Start Vite dev server
aubr dev:backend       # Run Convex only
aubr predev            # Ensure Convex is ready before `dev`

# Building
aubr build             # Build for production (Vite + SSR + type check)
aubr start             # Start production Node server

# Code Quality
aubr lint              # Run ESLint
aubr typecheck         # TypeScript only (`tsc --noEmit`)
aubr format            # Format with Prettier
aubr format:check      # Check Prettier formatting
aubr check             # Lint + typecheck + tests

# Testing
aubr test              # Run tests in watch mode
aubr test:once         # Run tests once
aubr test:debug        # Debug tests with inspector
aubr test:coverage     # Run with coverage report
```

### Adding New Features

```bash
# Add a new shadcn/ui component
aubx shadcn@latest add [component-name]

# Generate Convex types (after schema changes)
aubx convex codegen

# Open Convex dashboard
aubx convex dashboard
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file for the Vite frontend. Convex writes
`VITE_CONVEX_URL` (setup.sh ensures this key is present if Convex wrote a legacy
name) for the TanStack Start client.

```bash
# Auto-generated by `aubx convex dev`
VITE_CONVEX_URL=https://your-deployment.convex.cloud

# Written by ./scripts/setup-clerk-auth.sh (Clerk CLI)
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...

VITE_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/login
VITE_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/signup
VITE_CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/dashboard
VITE_CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/dashboard
```

`./scripts/setup-clerk-auth.sh` also sets `CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN` on Convex.

See [`.env.example`](./.env.example) and
[docs/AUTHENTICATION.md](./docs/AUTHENTICATION.md).

---

## Testing

This starter includes a complete testing setup with Vitest and convex-test:

```bash
# Run tests in watch mode
aubr test

# Run tests once (CI mode)
aubr test:once

# Run with coverage
aubr test:coverage
```

**Key patterns:**

- Tests run in isolated environment with mock database
- See [convex/TESTING.md](./convex/TESTING.md) for comprehensive testing guide

```typescript
import { convexTest } from "convex-test";
import { modules } from "./test.setup";
import schema from "./schema";

it("should test something", async () => {
  const t = convexTest(schema, modules);
  const result = await t.query(api.myModule.listItems, { count: 10 });
  expect(result).toEqual([]);
});
```

---

## Deployment

### Default Node Server Preset (Recommended for local / self-host)

1. **Push to GitHub**

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Build the application**

   ```bash
   aubr build
   ```

3. **Deploy Backend**

   ```bash
   aubx convex deploy
   ```

4. **Set Production Environment Variables**

   ```bash
   aubx convex env set CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN https://clerk.your-domain.com --prod
   ```

5. **Start the production Node server**

   ```bash
   aubr start
   ```

This project uses the default TanStack Start Node SSR preset. Vercel,
Cloudflare, and other presets can be added later by adjusting `vite.config.ts`
and the `start` script.

See [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](./docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed deployment
instructions, custom domains, and other platforms.
